It can be used to easily run a nodejs application on a server. It makes sure that the application keeps running or gets restarted when it crashes.

To start an application:

```bash
pm2 start app.js
```

Different managements of a pm2 instance:

```bash
pm2 restart app_name
pm2 reload app_name
pm2 stop app_name
pm2 delete app_name
```

To access the logs that are being generated by the application running:

```bash
pm2 logs
```
